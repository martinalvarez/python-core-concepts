# Python Core Concepts

A comprehensive reference of high-level Python programming patterns, ranging from core language fundamentals to advanced architecture and concurrency. This repository serves as a technical showcase of "Pythonic" code, design patterns, and industry best practices.

## 📂 Project Structure

* **`01_fundamentals/`**: Control flow, built-in data structures, and functional programming basics.
* **`02_oop_advanced/`**: Abstract Base Classes (ABCs), inheritance, polymorphism, and dunder methods.
* **`03_modern_python/`**: Type hinting, custom exceptions, and memory-efficient comprehensions.
* **`04_metaprogramming/`**: Decorators, generators, and context managers.
* **`05_concurrency/`**: Asynchronous programming (`asyncio`), threading, and multiprocessing.
* **`06_testing_devops/`**: Unit testing with `pytest`, mocking strategies, and environment management.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Standards

* **Version:** Python 3.10+
* **Typing:** Strict use of **Type Hints** for robust and self-documenting code.
* **Testing:** Implementation of the **Pytest** framework.
* **Documentation:** Clear **Docstrings** following professional conventions (Google/NumPy style).
